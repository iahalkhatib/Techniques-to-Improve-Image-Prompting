# Style Modifiers


Style modifiers are words that tell the AI what kind of art style or look you want. 

You can describe the colors, textures, shapes, and even mention famous artists or art styles.


Ex. 

A peaceful beach at sunset, painted in a bright and colorful way, like an impressionist painting.

Here, "bright and colorful" and "impressionist painting" are style modifiers.


# Quality Boosters


Quality boosters are words that make sure the image looks clear and detailed. 
They help the AI create high-resolution images that are sharp and easy to see.

Ex. 

A super-detailed, 4k picture of a dense forest with sharp, clear details and matching colors.

Here, "super-detailed," "4k," "sharp, clear details," and "matching colors" are quality boosters.


# Repetition


Repetition means using the same words more than once to make the AI focus on certain parts of the image.

This helps the AI create more diverse and interesting pictures.

Ex. 

A huge, huge desert with tiny, tiny footprints leading to a faraway, faraway oasis.

Here, "huge," "tiny," and "faraway" are repeated to emphasize them.


# Weighted Terms

Weighted terms are special words that you give more importance to. You can tell the AI to focus more on certain words to create stronger emotions or specific looks.

Ex. 

A fancy, {luxurious:10}, {shiny:8} hotel lobby with {simple:-5} decorations.

Here, "luxurious" and "shiny" are given more weight, while "simple" is given less weight.


# Fix Deformed Generations

Sometimes, the AI might make mistakes, like weird-looking hands or blurry parts. 

Using certain words can help fix these issues.

Ex. 

A picture of a person with clear, normal hands and feet, avoiding {weird hands:-10}, {blurry:-8}.

Here, "weird hands" and "blurry" are negative prompts to avoid problems.


# By using these techniques, you can create better image prompts that help the AI generate amazing pictures.
